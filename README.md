# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

the analysis we get is 

the purpose of this Project is analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufactures and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.
from over approximately 50 databases we choose the Video Games review and used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin.
